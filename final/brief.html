            <h2> Project Summary </h2>
            <p>
                I decided to go with my Every Picture project by adding visual designs and improving the user experience.

            <h2> Project Description </h2>
            <p>
                
For my "Every Picture" project, I've designed a "zoom-by-scroll" effect for my collection of stuffed animals, aiming to give users the feeling of viewing these animals as they would in a museum. Each animal is highlighted and introduced in turn. However, the current design simply displays the animals, with user interaction limited to scrolling and sliding.
            </p>
            <img src="images/sound.gif" alt="project img" width="300">
            <p>To enhance engagement and interactivity, I'm considering adding playful elements, such as cute emojis cascading from the top of the page when users scroll to each animal, creating a delightful surprise. Additionally, I'm thinking of incorporating a retro, PowerPoint-style sound button. When clicked, this button would play the corresponding animal's sound, adding an auditory dimension to the experience. On the usability front, I realized that the only way to switch between animals is through continuous scrolling. To streamline navigation, I plan to introduce buttons at the bottom of the page. Users can click these to jump directly to a specific animal. </p>
            <h2> Expert Feedback </h2>
            <p>To refine both the user experience and visual design, I intend to consult a design mentor who has previously guided me on a project. Furthermore, I'm considering reaching out to my designer group chat to see if anyone is interested in conducting usability tests for my project. I might also seek feedback on the coding aspect from a coworker who is a front-end developer at the company where I interned.</p>
