/* 
     My program capitalizes the first letter of each word in a lowercase string. Initially, I experimented with converting all letters to uppercase and lowercase. To capitalize the first letter, I utilized charAt(0) to target the initial character and slice to retrieve the remainder of the string. The main challenge was capitalizing the first letter of every word. To achieve this, I split the sentence into an array of words. By applying the same method within a loop, I ensured each word's initial letter was capitalized. Finally, I transformed the array back into a cohesive sentence. */


/*     var text = "ABCDE";
    var lowercaseText = text.toLowerCase();
    console.log(lowercaseText); */

/*     var text = "how are you doing?";
    var changeText = text.toUpperCase();
    console.log(changeText); */

 /*    var text = "how are you doing?";
    var changeText = text.charAt(0).toUpperCase()+text.slice(1);
    console.log(changeText) */

    var text = "how are you doing?";
    var changeText = text.split(" ");
    for(var i=0; i<changeText.length; i++){
        var uptext = changeText[i].charAt(0).toUpperCase() + changeText[i].slice(1);
        changeText[i] = uptext;
    }
    changeText = changeText.join(' ');
