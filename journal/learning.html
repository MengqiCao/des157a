            <p>The article <a href="https://uxdesign.cc/best-practices-for-form-design-ff5de6ca8e5f">Best practices for form design</a>offers many valuable guidelines for designers crafting forms. It emphasizes creating minimalist and user-friendly designs that encourage users to engage further. For instance, clearly indicating the form's steps can significantly boost user completion rates.</p>

            <p>Designing forms for mobile apps can be challenging due to space constraints. I frequently ponder the appropriate elements to use for specific properties. I've often questioned whether to use a stepper or an input field when designing a feature for number selection. Reading articles like this is enlightening, as they address nuanced issues I hadn't previously considered. The examples within the article further broaden my understanding, especially on designing user-friendly feedback.

            <p>I think <a href="https://www.duolingo.com/">Duolingo</a>exemplifies best practices of forms design, their sign-up process is super smooth, with well-organized input fields and intuitive error handling and intuative illustration design.  </p>
