            <h2>Overlays Design Pattern Research</h2>

                The article <a href="https://uxplanet.org/best-practices-for-modals-overlays-dialog-windows-c00c66cddd8c">Best Practices for Modals / Overlays / Dialog Windows</a> offers practical insights into dealing with overlays, including guidelines on when to use and when not to use them. It's incredibly useful, especially for someone like me who frequently incorporates overlays into app design. The Overlays is clear, straightforward, and efficient. But after reading the article, I recognized that overlays aren't always the best choice and can sometimes exacerbate issues.

            <p>
                One thing stood out to me is the anatomy of a modal window, it clearly indicates what should we include in an overlay. I think the most important things is the close button. The overlays without a close button can be seen everywhere and drives people crazy, especially in the ads and discount information in a shopping website. To retain the viewer's attention for longer, some designs make the close icon incredibly small, difficult to click, or even lock it with a countdown timer. Whenever I come across such an overlay, my immediate reaction is to exit the site. This reaction underscores the opposite of the intended effect. It reiterates that overlays should be used to interrupt a user's current task only when it's essential to draw their full attention to something more significant.

            <h2>Design Best Practices</h2>
            <time datetime="2023-10-15">October 15th, 2023</time>
            <p>The article <a href="https://uxdesign.cc/best-practices-for-form-design-ff5de6ca8e5f">Best practices for form design</a>offers many valuable guidelines for designers crafting forms. It emphasizes creating minimalist and user-friendly designs that encourage users to engage further. For instance, clearly indicating the form's steps can significantly boost user completion rates.</p>

            <p>Designing forms for mobile apps can be challenging due to space constraints. I frequently ponder the appropriate elements to use for specific properties. I've often questioned whether to use a stepper or an input field when designing a feature for number selection. Reading articles like this is enlightening, as they address nuanced issues I hadn't previously considered. The examples within the article further broaden my understanding, especially on designing user-friendly feedback.
            </p>

            <p>I think <a href="https://www.duolingo.com/">Duolingo</a>exemplifies best practices of forms design, their sign-up process is super smooth, with well-organized input fields and intuitive error handling and intuative illustration design.  </p>
